##### Game Concept
Space Scavengers will be a top-down space shooter inspired by classic games such as Space Invaders.  The player will control a ship where they must evade and destroy incoming enemies.  The player will have access to multiple weapons, which can be enhanced using an in-game currency dropped from fallen enemies, as well as additional ships.  Fallen enemies also increase the player’s score, with a goal to beat their previous high score.  The game will have an infinite game mode where enemies will continue to spawn until the player is destroyed; there will also be a campaign mode with pre-planned levels where a player must reach the end and destroy a boss.  The game will have “space scavengers” which are drones that will collect in-game currency while you are away; when active they can be used as a weapon.
